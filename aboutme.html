      Hey! I'm Maya Ostrowski. 
      I'm currently a Junior at Ridgewood Highschool in Illinois. 
      I am in the Class Council executive board, Student Council, and the Spanish Honor Society.
      I also participate in volleyball, cross-country as well as track and field.
      I am currently enrolled in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, where I will learn the basics of code alongside the girls in my program.
